dexdump
=======

The dexdump tool, a dialect of objdump, is no longer available at Android SDK.
Only necessary (i.e., dependant) files are extracted from Android source tree.
To build the tool, just type:

    $ make

Then, copy the executable file into anywhere you want:

    $ cp a.out /path/to/platform-tools
